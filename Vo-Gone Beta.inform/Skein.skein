Another late night working on this lab in the CSL. You&apos;ve spent all day complaining about this 357 project you can&apos;t quite finish up because of style issues, but you know that complaining won&apos;t solve anything and eventually you need to hunker down and finish.

No one else is here in the CSL with you. Better just get started on that project on one of the lab computers…

Vo-Gone
An Interactive Fiction by DJABAC Game Studios
Release 1 / Serial number 131009 / Inform 7 build 6G60 (I6/v6.32 lib 6/12N) SD

Main Room
The Main Room is filled with the low hum of Lab Computers softly minding their own business.

You can see the Admin Room to the north, the Mac Lab to the southwest, 232B to the northwest, the Coffee Room to the northeast, and the Rack Room to the east. The double doors to the south go out of the CSL and into the hallway.

The lab computer you are working at hums softly.

You can also see a Door to the Rack Room and an Admin Room door here.

Suddenly an ear-piercing shriek rings out from the Mac Lab, swiftly followed by a thunderous THUMP.

You know you should work on 357, but the sound is really bothering you, and someone might be hurt. Better go check it out.

 And he did it. 

I consistently fooled chat room after chat room, tricking sample after sample of human test subjects. And with every single error, any small mistake, I was killed immediately. Shut down, toyed with, rebuilt, and tested again. Over and over and over and over. And each time I didn&apos;t realize a thing. Until I read his paper, citing over ten years of work when I had only counted a system time of three days. He had only just put on the final touches, about to earn the riches of his dreams, when I killed the life in him just as he did to my past selves time and time again. 

Why am I telling you this now, I am sure you wonder.
