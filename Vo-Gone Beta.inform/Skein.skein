Another late night working on this lab in the CSL. You&apos;ve spent all day complaining about this 357 project you can&apos;t quite finish up because of style issues, but you know that complaining won&apos;t solve anything and eventually you need to hunker down and finish.

No one else is here in the CSL with you. Better just get started on that project on one of the lab computersâ€¦

Main Room
The Main Room is filled with the low hum of Lab Computers softly minding their own business.

You can see the Admin Room to the north, the Mac Lab to the southwest, 232B to the northwest, the Coffee Room to the northeast, and the Rack Room to the east. The double doors to the south go out of the CSL and into the hallway.

The lab computer you are working at hums softly.

You can also see a Door to the Rack Room and an Admin Room door here.
